        <p class="project-description"> The Solar Mist Irrigation System project addresses the need for sustainable solutions in small-scale plant irrigation. Leveraging advancements in agrotronics, we developed an automated mist irrigation system integrated with IoT technologies as project for the EIA University. This system enables users to monitor water levels, irrigation schedules, and upcoming irrigation times through an internet-connected device or the system's LCD display.

        <p class="project-description">Initially, the irrigation system was developed using an Arduino UNO microcontroller. The Arduino monitored soil humidity and activated watering based on a predefined setpoint. While the first prototype did not support wireless communication, it successfully utilized solar energy. The system included a 21.85V, 100W solar panel connected to a regulator, which managed energy distribution to the water pump and battery. Two separate power circuits were designed: one for the renewable energy-powered pump and another for the Arduino, powered by a 9V battery.

        <img src="/img/mist/raspagro.jpg" alt="Project Image 3" class="project-img-left">
        <p class="project-description">The Internet of Things (IoT) capabilities were integrated into the project by replacing the microcontroller with a Raspberry Pi 3, which was connected to the internet and a Balena server. This upgrade enabled remote monitoring and hard resets of the system, enhancing overall control and reliability. Additionally, the use of Balena facilitated scalability, as code updates could be seamlessly deployed across all microcontrollers connected to the specific server. This prototype also incorporated a new sensor for measuring the tank's water level, providing more comprehensive data for system management.<br><br>

        The design, cutting, and assembly of the container were also key components of the project. The enclosure was meticulously designed to be weatherproof and capable of housing all system components. Acrylic was chosen as the material due to its availability and suitability for the project requirements. The design process was carried out using Autodesk Inventor Professional 2022, ensuring precision and accuracy. The cutting was executed with a laser cutter, resulting in a robust and well-fitted enclosure.
