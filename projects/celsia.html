      <p class="project-description">
        This project explores <strong>fault detection in electric distribution grids</strong> using only 
        daily energy consumption data (kWh) provided by <strong>CELSIA S.A. E.S.P.</strong>.
        Due to the lack of electrical variables such as voltage, current, or power quality metrics,
        the challenge centered on extracting meaningful anomaly indicators from a low-resolution dataset.
        The work followed the <strong>ASUM-DM</strong> data-mining methodology and evaluated several 
        unsupervised models to cluster consumption profiles and detect irregular behavior.
      </p>

      <p>
        My main contributions included:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Full preprocessing pipeline</strong> for filtering, cleaning, validating, and transforming all meter data</li>
        <li><strong>Feature engineering</strong> (sinusoidal time encoding, net consumption, contextual variables)</li>
        <li><strong>Implementation and tuning</strong> of multiple clustering algorithms (K-Means, MiniBatch, Birch, DBSCAN, GMM)</li>
        <li><strong>Hyperparameter optimization</strong> using elbow criterion, silhouette analysis, dendrograms, BIC, and density analysis</li>
        <li><strong>Interpretation of clustering results</strong>, with detailed anomaly/outlier characterization</li>
        <li><strong>Final model selection</strong> based on operational constraints and failure-detection goals</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="project-description">
        The original dataset contained daily cumulative energy readings from 401 meters over one year.
        Because <strong>KWH_IMPORT is incremental</strong>, all net consumptions were computed using adjacent differences,
        while discarding invalid or saturated readings. Eight meters with constant consumption were removed.
      </p>

      <p class="project-description">
        Time variables were decomposed into <strong>sin-cos cyclic encodings</strong> (day and month),
        and meter-level context features were engineered:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>CONSUMO_NETO</strong> - net daily consumption</li>
        <li><strong>METER_STD_CONSUMO</strong> - meter variability</li>
        <li><strong>CONSUMO_DEVIATION</strong> - deviation from the meter's mean behavior</li>
        <li>Cyclic <strong>DIA_sin/cos</strong> and <strong>MES_sin/cos</strong></li>
      </ul>

      <p class="project-description">
        After univariate and multivariate exploration, redundant variables were removed and
        all features were scaled with <strong>MinMaxScaler</strong>.  
        The final dataset contained <strong>140,628 entries</strong>.
      </p>

      <!-- Model Construction -->
      <h3 class="pr-subtitle">Model Construction</h3>

      <img src="/img/celsia/dendo.png" alt="Clustering Models" class="project-img-left">

      <p class="project-description">
        Following ASUM-DM guidelines, several clustering algorithms were trained and compared:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>K-Means</strong>: evaluated k = 2-15 using elbow & silhouette analysis</li>
        <li><strong>MiniBatchKMeans</strong>: reduced computational cost, k = 4</li>
        <li><strong>Birch</strong>: hyperparameters tuned to enforce 4 clusters</li>
        <li><strong>DBSCAN</strong>: epsilon and min_samples tuned through k-distance curves and grid search</li>
        <li><strong>Gaussian Mixture Models</strong>: covariance types tested, final model chosen using <strong>BIC minimization</strong></li>
      </ul>

      <p class="project-description">
        Silhouette scores, cluster separability, and operational interpretability were used as the main selection criteria.
        Although K-Means with k=12 scored highest mathematically, operational constraints favored a 
        <strong>reduced number of clusters (≤ 5)</strong> to meaningfully classify states such as normal, sector failure, or anomalies.
      </p>

      <!-- Results -->
      <h3 class="pr-subtitle">Results & Cluster Interpretation</h3>

      <img src="/img/celsia/cover.png" alt="Cluster Results" class="project-img">

      <p class="project-description">
        The final selected model was <strong>K-Means with k = 5</strong>, which balanced 
        statistical performance and operational interpretability.
      </p>

      <p class="project-description">
        Across all models, the data exhibited <strong>high internal variability</strong> and
        <strong>large numbers of outliers in every cluster</strong>.  
        Boxplots showed that consumption anomalies were not localized to specific groups—
        instead, outliers appeared throughout the entire network, making it impossible to identify
        reliable “representative meters” for each cluster.
      </p>

      <p class="project-description">
        Cluster means were nearly identical (1.95–2.09 kWh), but their <strong>variances differed</strong>:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Cluster 1 showed the <strong>highest variability</strong> → noisy or unstable consumption</li>
        <li>Cluster 0, 2, and 3 were structurally similar</li>
        <li>Cluster 4 had slightly higher variability but remained within typical ranges</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="project-description">
        These results indicate that the data naturally separates consumers into behavioral profiles,
        but does not isolate <strong>distinct electrical fault modes</strong>.  
        This is consistent with the fundamental limitation: consumption in kWh is an 
        <strong>aggregated, low-resolution signal</strong> that hides fast transient behaviors typical of real faults.
      </p>

      <!-- Conclusions -->
      <h3 class="pr-subtitle">Conclusions</h3>

      <img src="/img/celsia/pattern.png" alt="Conclusion" class="project-img-right">

      <p class="project-description">
        The project successfully produced a full data-driven characterization of consumption behavior for 401 meters,
        revealing distinct but subtly separated consumer profiles.  
        However, due to the <strong>absence of electrical variables</strong> (voltage, current, RMS values),
        none of the unsupervised models could isolate clear failure states.
      </p>

      <p class="project-description">
        The work concludes that:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Daily kWh consumption alone is <strong>insufficient</strong> for reliable fault detection.</li>
        <li>The clustering results are valuable for <strong>consumer profiling</strong>, not diagnosis.</li>
        <li>High variability and widespread outliers reduce cluster separability.</li>
        <li>A fault-oriented model requires <strong>higher-resolution electrical data</strong>.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="project-description">
        Despite the limitations, the pipeline offers a <strong>solid foundation</strong> for integrating future 
        high-resolution electrical measurements and for developing anomaly-detection models that do not rely on balanced clusters.
      </p>
