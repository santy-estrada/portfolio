        <p class="project-description"> The hovercraft project was undertaken as part of a multidisciplinary engineering challenge: to design, construct, and evaluate a hovercraft capable of traversing smooth solid surfaces and water with minimal friction and high efficiency. A key requirement was the integration of an energy generation mechanism using renewable energy sources. </p>
        <p> The project began with an in-depth literature review to identify critical design factors for hovercraft performance and energy generation. The review highlighted that:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Air-Cushion Design</strong>: Circular air-cushions provide the most efficient lift. However, for improved forward motion, a rectangular design with rounded edges and an arc-shaped front was deemed optimal to reduce drag and enhance stability. Avoiding sharp edges was essential for minimizing turbulence and energy loss.</li>
            <li><strong>Generation</strong>: Various energy harvesting methods were considered, including solar panels, wind turbines, and piezoelectric materials. Using decision matrices to evaluate feasibility, efficiency, and integration potential, the team selected solar panels as the most suitable option.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h3 class="pr-subtitle">Design and Prototyping</h3>
        <img src="/img/hover/cad.png" alt="Project Image 2" class = "project-img-right"> 
        <p class="project-description">The hovercraft was developed in iterative phases, with 3D CAD modeling and construction proceeding concurrently. Each phase addressed a critical subsystem, ensuring that the CAD designs were always one step ahead of physical assembly. This phased approach enabled rapid prototyping, testing, and refinement of individual components. <br>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Air-Cushion System</strong>: The air-cushion system, essential for lift and smooth operation, presented the most significant challenges. Multiple prototypes were constructed and tested to achieve minimal friction and optimal air distribution. The final design utilized carefully calculated dimensions and materials to enhance performance.</li>
          <li><strong>Propulsion System</strong>: The propulsion system was designed to provide sufficient thrust for both ground and water mobility. Propellers and fans were selected and integrated based on performance simulations and real-world testing.</li>
          <li><strong>Energy Generation</strong>: The energy generation system was integrated into the hovercraft's structure, with solar panels strategically placed to maximize exposure to sunlight. The system was designed to charge a battery bank.</li>
          <li><strong>Directional Control</strong>: Directional control mechanisms, including rudders and steering systems, were incorporated to ensure precision and agility during movement on both surfaces.</li>
          <li><strong>Protection Systems</strong>: To safeguard electronic components from water exposure, especially during water-based operations, custom enclosures and protective features were designed and fabricated.</li>
        </ol>
        <img src="/img/hover/front.jpg" alt="Project Image 3" class="project-img-left">

        The construction utilized a combination of MDF for structural elements and 3D-printed components for complex geometries. Fasteners, including screws and bolts, facilitated modular assembly and disassembly, enabling easy troubleshooting and iterative improvements. Solar panels were mounted securely, and the electrical systems were integrated with detailed schematic designs.
        </p>
        <h3 class="pr-subtitle">Competition Performance</h3>
        <p class="project-description">The completed hovercraft was tested in a university-level competition consisting of three categories:
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Ground Agility Test</strong>: The hovercraft demonstrated good maneuverability and low friction, securing second place.</li>
            <li><strong>Water Agility Test</strong>: The vehicle excelled in handling turns and maintaining stability, achieving first place.</li>
            <li><strong>Water Race</strong>: Superior propulsion and direction systems propelled the hovercraft to victory in the race.</li>
          </ul>
          By winning two out of three events, the team emerged as the overall competition champions, showcasing the effectiveness of their design and engineering processes.
