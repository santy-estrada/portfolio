        <p class="project-description"> The project involved designing a soft robotic gripper based on a PneuNet actuator, which features a series of interconnected chambers that deform when pressurized. The design was developed through an extensive literature review, focusing on proven concepts in soft robotics. The gripper was constructed using Ecoflex, a popular material in the field for its flexibility and durability. The process began with downloading and 3D printing the molds from CAD files. Once the molds were prepared, Ecoflex was mixed, poured into the molds, and allowed to cure in a vacuum chamber to eliminate any air bubbles and ensure a smooth, defect-free final product.

        <p class="project-description">After testing the first finger of the soft robotic gripper, a base was 3D printed to support the construction of a full gripper. Three additional fingers were created to complete the assembly. Once the gripper was fully manufactured, a series of grip tests were conducted to evaluate its performance. The gripper was used to manipulate various objects, including a soft actuator, an icopor cup, and a plastic spoon, to assess its versatility and effectiveness. These tests, demonstrated the gripper's ability to handle different items. The gripper was driven using the pneumatic network from EIA University, ensuring proper functionality and performance during testing.
