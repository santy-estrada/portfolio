        <p class="project-description"> A Jhon-Wick-Inspired web application was developed to manage personal tasks and activities. The project aimed to create a user-friendly platform. The front end was developed using Vue, while the back end was built with TypeScript. The application utilized MongoDB as the database to store user information and task data. The project also incorporated user authentication and authorization features to ensure data security and privacy.

        <p class="project-description">The project involved creating a  web application with a structured user management system, supporting multiple clearance levels. The application was designed to accommodate four distinct user roles: admins, managers, and two types of regular users, each with specific permissions and functionalities. Admins had the highest level of access, enabling them to create new entries, assign tasks, and mark tasks as completed. Managers had a more restricted role, limited to marking tasks as completed and creating new tasks, but without the ability to assign them. Regular users had access to view only their assigned tasks and could review the history of completed tasks. 
        </p>

        <img src="/img/jwick2.png" alt="Project Image 3" class="project-img-left">
        <p class="project-description">
        The web application featured both registration and login pages, which connected to a MongoDB database to handle user data. This setup allowed for secure storage and retrieval of user information. To enhance security, passwords were obfuscated to prevent unauthorized access. The applicationâ€™s role-based access control ensured that each user type could only perform actions appropriate to their role, thus maintaining a clear and functional workflow within the system.
